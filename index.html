        <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                Spitfire was formed in 2018 by four singers from the Ambassadors of Harmony. 
                They won the Central States District Quartet Contest in 2019, and due to unforeseen circumstances held that title for three years. 
                They have had the wonderful fortune of competing in the last three Barbershop Harmony Society International Competitions (2019, 2022, and 2023), and performing for audiences across the country. 
                The quartet is comprised of Stephen Vandenberg (tenor), Chris Pingel (lead), Austin Veteto (baritone), and JT Reid (bass). 
                They enjoy singing a variety of genres of music and display, as some have called it, "real dad energy."
